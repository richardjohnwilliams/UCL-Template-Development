      <p></p>
      <p>Advising, lobbying, and campaigning involve diverse stakeholders with
        varying degrees of influence and power.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p><strong>Science advice stakeholders</strong> typically have higher
        levels of knowledge and are skill-oriented, providing objective advisory
        positions. Lobbying stakeholders, while possessing adequate knowledge,
        are issue-oriented and often act as 'voices for hire' for private
        interests.</p>
      <p><strong>Campaigning stakeholders</strong> are also issue-oriented but
        focus on promoting a cause and operate as public actors.</p>
      <p><strong>Actors providing Science advice to governments
          include:</strong> Chief scientific advisors, Departmental scientific
        advisors, Advisory councils, Advisory committees and National academies.

      <p>In many settings, lobbyists and campaigners can take on interchangeable

              <h4>The Science behind the Ketogenic Diet</h4>
              <p style="text-align: left;">In the past decades, various low-carb
                diets have caused a sensation, attracting fans and showcasing
                success stories worldwide. A low-carb variant has recently been
                gaining more and more attention: the ketogenic diet. No longer
                just a fad, it has long been recommended by doctors and in
                academic journals for many years now. In fact, mainstream media
                itself has been unable to stop its momentum, as the ABC
                primetime show invested $250,000 in the <span

              <p style="text-align: left;">The advancement and benefits in
                researching the Ketogentic diet framed a landmark conference on
                Science Advice to Governments, held in Auckland in August 2014.
                Hosted and chaired by <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a

      <h4 class="text-left">Influence Mapping and Stakeholder Analysis</h4>
      <p>Influence Mapping identifies the individuals and groups with the
        <strong>power</strong> <strong>to effect a key decision</strong>. It
        further investigates <strong>the position and</strong>
        <strong>motives</strong> of each player and the best
        <strong>channels</strong> through which to communicate with them.</p>
      <p>According to <span class="MsoHyperlink"><a
            href="https://odi.org/en/publications/context-assessment-influence-mapping/">ODI
            2009</a></span>, the approach is also known as <strong>Stakeholder
          Influence Mapping</strong>, Power Mapping or the Arena of Influence.

      <p><strong>Stakeholder Mapping and Analysis:</strong> Identifying and
        understanding the roles, interests, and influence of various
        stakeholders ensures that all relevant voices are considered in the
        policy-making process.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Stakeholder Analysis is a methodology used to
        <strong>facilitate</strong> <strong>institutional and policy reform
          processes</strong> by accounting for and often incorporating the needs
        of those who have a <strong>‘stake’ or an interest</strong> in the
        reforms under consideration.</p>
